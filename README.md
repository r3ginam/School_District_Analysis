# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
Maria, the chief data scientist for a school district, tasked the analyst with aggregating student test score data and showcase trends in student performance. The results and summary of this task will be used by the school board and superintendent to make decisions regarding school budgets and spending. 

After some analysis, the school board discovered academic dishonesty amongst 9th graders at Thomas High School (THS). In order to uphold state-testing standards, the analyst has been tasked with replacing 9th grade test scores at THS with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data in tact. Then, the data analyst repeated the analysis to discovered how this dishonesty affected the overall data.
